Design a Graphical User-interface (50 points) 

Choose one of the following transition procedures from the use cases to your menu hierarchy: 
  Use case groupings by first-cut menus, or 
  Storyboards. 

Using CSS, HTML, VB, JavaScript, Java, or C#, design the client-side system interface prototypes for your solution. At this point, just the look and feel, not the back end functionality. User interface prototype must address all major features of the project. Use HCI best practices in your design.
